# Slottery â€“ the slack lottery.

With Slottery, members of a Slack channel can be drawn and notified. For example, Slottery can be used to organize lunch or coffee dates with randomly selected colleagues.

Slottery is a Node.js application powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [axios](https://axios-http.com/). It requires an authorized [Bot user token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#granular_bot) to interact with your teams's Slack workspace using the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/).
